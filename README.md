## Description

My professional portfolio page built in React. This site was developed with Tailwindcss. This site incorporates Flexbox and extensive media queries, because I am very picky about my aesthetics.

To install this application do a `git clone` and `npm install` in the project root.


# Usage

This is a single page application. Users can scroll down to view all sections, or use the nav menu to navigate quickly to section IDs.


# Contribute

If you would like to contribute please send me a DM. Since this is my personal portfolio, I am not accepting contributors at this time.


# Tests

This app was not built with test-driven development. Console logs were used to test functions.
